# Plagiarism Detector using Amazon SageMaker

## Project Overview

This is the final solution of the Plagiarism Detector Project for the Udacity ML Engineer Nanodegree program. It examins a text file and performs bindary classification; labeling the file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar the text file is to a provided source text.

This project is broken down into three main notebooks:

- Notebook 1: Data Exploration
- Notebook 2: Feature Engineering
- Notebook 3: Training and Deploying Model in SageMaker

## Software and Libraries

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Random Classifier
- Amazon SageMaker
